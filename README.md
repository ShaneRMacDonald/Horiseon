First commit - Changed body to .body in line 7 of the style.css so the element modifier functions properly and combined multiple elements sharing the same modification properties for simplification.

Second commit - Changed calibri to 'calibri' as it was not properly being recognized as an applicable font type.

Third commit - Made 2 changes the first adding scaling for mobile devices and the second changing the title to something more appropriate.

Fourth commit - Added code so the link for Search Engine Optimization now works and changed the <div> containing the footer to <footer>
